                    The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs, Amritsar.
                    The Golden temple is famous for its full golden dome, it is one of the most sacred pilgrim
                     spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built on a 67-ft square of marble and is a two storied structure.
                     In 1581, Guru Arjan initiated the construction of the Gurdwara. During the construction the pool
                      was kept empty and dry. It took 8 years to complete the first version of the Harmandir Sahib</p>
